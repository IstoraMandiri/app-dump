# Meteor App-Dump

### A Simple In-App Backup/Restore solution for Meteor

[![App-Dump UI Demo](http://i.imgur.com/rlSvUzB.png)](http://app-dump-example.meteor.com)

:exclamation: This package should be used a simple tool to aid development. Use `mongodump` and `mongorestore` proper for mission critical operations.

:warning: Restoring a backup will destroy existing data.

:thumbsup: Works on meteor.com hosting


## Usage

Example: http://app-dump-example.meteor.com/, or check the `/example` folder

Generates a downloadable tar backup of the current mongo database, which can be uploaded to restore.

Use `{{> appDumpUI}}` to add download and upload UI to your template.

Secure the download and upload method on the server:

```coffeescript
if Meteor.isServer
  appDump.allow = ->
    # do your own auth here -- eg. check if user is an admin...
    if @user?.admin
      return true
```

Additionally, if you're using iron-router hooks to secure your routes, use the following to add an exception (thanks @Khalid545):

```coffeescript
Router.onBeforeAction IR_Filters.mustBeSignedIn,
  except: ['appDumpHTTP']
```

You can use `{{> appDumpUI advanced=true}}` to get additional options:

* JSON/BSON Output Format - you can only restore in BSON format at the moment
* Drop collections on restore
* Specific collection backup
* Specific query backup (in JSON format, eg `{"deleted":false}`)


## What's wrong with [`hitchcott:backup-restore`](https://github.com/hitchcott/meteor-backup-restore/)?

It doesn't work with the meteor.com deployment servers because it requires MongoDB to be installed on the host system. 

`hitchcott:app-dump` uses a pure node implementation, so does not require `mongodump` or `mongorestore`. It also uses streams for serving the tar, so it's a bit more efficient and secure.


## TODO

```
- [bug] I have experienced an issue with large grid-fs collections being restored while writes are occuring.
- Tests
